                useless
                piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker
                jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind
                people
                will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.
